# Octopress 3 Documentation (Book Edition)

by Brandon Mathis et al

> **Note:** The book edition is still an early release and a work-in-progess.


This is the (official) documentation
for Octopress 3 - an obsessively designed collection of tools and addons
for the Jekyll static site builder / generator - 
reformatted in a single-page book edition.

See the [source repo](https://github.com/hydepress/hydepress.github.io) for how
the book gets auto-built with "plain" Jekyll - of course - and hosted on GitHub Pages.
